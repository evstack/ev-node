# Rollkit Dependency Graph

![Dependency Graph](./dependency-graph.drawio.svg)

We use the following color coding in this Graph:

- No Colour: Work not yet started
- Yellow Box: Work in progress
- Green Box: Work completed or at least unblocking the next dependency
- Red Border: Work needs to happen in cooperation with another team

If the EPICs are not linked to the box yet, it means that this box has currently no priority or is still in the ideation phase or the dependency is unclear.
