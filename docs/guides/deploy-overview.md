# Deploying Your Chain

One of the benefits of building chains with Evolve is the flexibility you have as a developer to choose things like the DA layer, the settlement scheme, and the execution environment.

The challenge that comes with this flexibility is that there are more services that now need to be deployed and managed while running your chain.

In the tutorials so far, you've seen various helper scripts used to make things easier. While great for tutorials, there are better ways to deploy and manage chains than using various bash scripts.

In this section, you'll see a few examples of how you can deploy your chain environment with all your services running in a more production-ready way.

:::warning Disclaimer
These examples are for educational purposes only. Before deploying your chain for production use you should fully understand the services you are deploying and your choice in deployment method.
