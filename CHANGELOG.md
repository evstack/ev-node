## [Unreleased]

### Added

<!-- New features or capabilities -->
- Added automated upgrade test for the `evm-single` app that verifies compatibility when moving from v1.0.0-beta.8 to HEAD in CI ([#2780](https://github.com/evstack/ev-node/pull/2780))
- Added execution-layer replay mechanism so nodes can resynchronize by replaying missed batches against the executor ([#2771](https://github.com/evstack/ev-node/pull/2771))
- Added cache-pruning logic that evicts entries once heights are finalized to keep node memory usage bounded ([#2761](https://github.com/evstack/ev-node/pull/2761))
- Added Prometheus gauges and counters that surface DA submission failures, pending blobs, and resend attempts for easier operational monitoring ([#2756](https://github.com/evstack/ev-node/pull/2756))
- Added gRPC execution client implementation for remote execution services using Connect-RPC protocol ([#2490](https://github.com/evstack/ev-node/pull/2490))
- Added `ExecutorService` protobuf definition with InitChain, GetTxs, ExecuteTxs, and SetFinal RPCs ([#2490](https://github.com/evstack/ev-node/pull/2490))
- Added new `grpc` app for running EVNode with a remote execution layer via gRPC ([#2490](https://github.com/evstack/ev-node/pull/2490))

### Changed

<!-- Changes to existing functionality -->
- Hardened signer CLI and block pipeline per security audit: passphrases must be provided via `--evnode.signer.passphrase_file`, data/header validation enforces metadata and timestamp checks, and the reaper backs off on failures (BREAKING) ([#2764](https://github.com/evstack/ev-node/pull/2764))
- Added retries around executor `ExecuteTxs` calls to better tolerate transient execution errors ([#2784](https://github.com/evstack/ev-node/pull/2784))
- Increased default `ReadinessMaxBlocksBehind` from 3 to 30 blocks so `/health/ready` stays true during normal batch sync ([#2779](https://github.com/evstack/ev-node/pull/2779))
- Replaced uses of `interface{}` with `any` across tooling to align with modern Go style ([#2781](https://github.com/evstack/ev-node/pull/2781))
- Updated `pkg/sync` README with current component responsibilities and flow diagrams ([#2776](https://github.com/evstack/ev-node/pull/2776))
- Removed deprecated `// +build` constraints from Go helper scripts in favor of `//go:build` ([#2774](https://github.com/evstack/ev-node/pull/2774))
- Updated cache-analyzer tooling to Go 1.21 `slices.Sort` helpers for clearer ordering semantics ([#2768](https://github.com/evstack/ev-node/pull/2768))
- Clarified sequencing documentation and inline comments around the “target chain” wording ([#2762](https://github.com/evstack/ev-node/pull/2762))
- Updated EVM execution client to use new `txpoolExt_getTxs` RPC API for retrieving pending transactions as RLP-encoded bytes

### Deprecated

<!-- Features that will be removed in future versions -->
-

### Removed

<!-- Features that were removed -->
- Removed `LastCommitHash`, `ConsensusHash`, and `LastResultsHash` from the canonical header representation in favor of slim headers (BREAKING; legacy hashes now live under `Header.Legacy`) ([#2766](https://github.com/evstack/ev-node/pull/2766))

### Fixed

<!-- Bug fixes -->
- Restored backwards-compatible header signature verification so legacy networks can sync with slim headers ([#2782](https://github.com/evstack/ev-node/pull/2782))
- Pass correct namespaces for header and data to the da layer for posting ([#2560](https://github.com/evstack/ev-node/pull/2560))

- Use technical jargon without explanation
- Write from developer perspective
- Include every minor change
