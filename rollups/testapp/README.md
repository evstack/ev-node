# Test Application

This application serves as an example to help you understand how to create your own application using this framework. It provides a basic implementation that you can use as a reference when building your own solution.

## Important Note

When implementing your own application, it's your responsibility to provide the appropriate Executor dependency. This is a crucial component that needs to be properly implemented according to your specific requirements.

## Installation

To install and test the application, you can use the following command:

```bash
make install
```

This will build and install all necessary dependencies for running the test application.

## Usage

This is a reference implementation. Feel free to explore the code and use it as a starting point for your own application. Make sure to:

1. Review the existing code structure
2. Understand how the Executor is implemented
3. Adapt the implementation to your specific needs

Remember that this is just an example, and your actual implementation might require different approaches depending on your use case.
